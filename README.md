# Hydration Bot

TODO:
- Brainstorm a better name
- Find out how to actually build this
- Decide how to sorta promote it
- Have two modes: 30m (or so) and 1h30m (or so) (this is just so there's more range in between)
- Have a pretty decent README (I've got this - doamatto)

MUST-DOSâ„¢:
- Make it opt-in (it would eat a lot of resources if we didn't)
- Make it only when live (again, for preserving resources)
