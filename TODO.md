TODO:
- Brainstorm a better name
- ~~Find out how to actually build this~~
- Decide how to sorta promote it
- Have two modes: 30m (or so) and 1h30m (or so) (this is just so there's more range in between)
- ~~Have a pretty decent README (I've got this - doamatto)~~ Done in: `[9a30626](https://github.com/doamatto/hydrationbot/commit/9a30626)`
- Figure out if/how to do per-channel config.
- (Idea) Change languages (the easiest would be: EN, FR, ES) based off ISO 639-1

MUST-DOSâ„¢:
- Make it opt-in (it would eat a lot of resources if we didn't)
- Make it only when live (again, for preserving resources)
