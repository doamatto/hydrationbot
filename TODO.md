TODO:
- Brainstorm a better name
- ~~Find out how to actually build this~~
- Decide how to sorta promote it
- Have two modes: 30m (or so) and 1h30m (or so) (this is just so there's more range in between)
- ~~Have a pretty decent README (I've got this - doamatto).~~ Done in [9a30626](https://github.com/doamatto/hydrationbot/commit/9a30626)
- Figure out if/how to do per-channel config.
- Vareied messages whenever alerted to drink some water.
- (Idea) If the stream is marked for mature audiences, slightly more mature phrases are said (Functionality added in [0b64d3c](https://github.com/doamatto/hydrationbot/commit/0b64d3c))
- (Idea) Change languages (the easiest would be: EN, FR, ES) based off ISO 639-1. (Functionality added in [6cc42b1](https://github.com/doamatto/hydrationbot/commit/6cc42b1))

MUST-DOSâ„¢:
- Make it opt-in (it would eat a lot of resources if we didn't)
- Make it only when live (again, for preserving resources)
